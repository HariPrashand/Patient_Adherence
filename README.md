## Overview
The Patient Adherence project aims to improve patient adherence to medication schedules using data analysis and machine learning. The project leverages Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and Python for building predictive models.

## Features
- Data analysis and visualization
- Predictive modeling to identify patients at risk of non-adherence
- Interactive dashboards for monitoring adherence

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HariPrashand/Patient_Adherence.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Patient_Adherence
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv env
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the relevant notebooks to explore data and run models.

## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **Python**: For data processing and model building.
- **HTML**: For any web-based components.
